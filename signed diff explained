How do I interpret it?

    signed_diff > 0 (positive):
    Wrestler was over-promoted (placed higher than expected) or under-demoted (not demoted as far as expected).

    signed_diff < 0 (negative):
    Wrestler was under-promoted (placed lower than expected) or over-demoted (demoted more than expected).

    signed_diff = 0:
    Wrestler was placed exactly at the “bullseye” spot predicted by a win-loss based algorithm.
