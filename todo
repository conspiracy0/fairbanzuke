TODO:
    Add options for putting Sanyaku ranks by newcomers in sanyaku heuristics (putting S2w etc)


    Run the first basho results and find out the ozeki changed name stuff


    Create the "true banzuke" by running only sims on our made up banzukes

    Make the compare banzuke work with name changes?
