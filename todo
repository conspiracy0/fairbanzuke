TODO:
    Add options for putting Sanyaku ranks by newcomers in sanyaku heuristics (putting S2w etc)

    Fix the true rank title output for good with making it dependent on each basho rather than a universal print table

    check for duplicate entries -- found for sure in 202101banzuke, ishiura

    Create the "true banzuke" by running only sims on our made up banzukes

    Make the compare banzuke work with name changes?
